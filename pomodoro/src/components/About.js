          <ul>
            <li>Decide on the task to be done.</li>
            <li>
              Set the Pomodoro timer in the Settings (typically for 25 minutes).
            </li>
            <li>Work on the task.</li>
            <li>
              End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically
              5â€“10 minutes,set this time in Settings).
            </li>
            <li>
              Go back to Step 2 and repeat until you complete four pomodoros.
            </li>
            <li>
              After four pomodoros are done, take a long break (typically 20 to
              30 minutes,set this time in Settings) instead of a short break.
              Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
